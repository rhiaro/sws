# Semantic Web Systems

## Course description

The Semantic Web has been held up as an extension of the current Web by Tim Berners-Lee. According to this vision, the Web becomes a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge. For this to happen, Web content needs to be expressed in a form where it can be processed intelligently by software agents.

Some aspects of the Semantic Web have already been developed as specifications and implementations. Other parts are still highly speculative or too challenging to solve yet, but are the subject of considerable research and experimentation. As well as addressing techniques for representing information on the Web, we need to consider techniques for allowing agents to cooperate in using this information, and here we draw on techniques and results from agent-based systems.
